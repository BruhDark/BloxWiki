# !nickname

## Usage

```text
!nickname <_> | <global_nickname
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Bind Nickname** → when you link groups, you're given the option to change nicknames of group members. Bloxlink will choose the person's **highest role** which has an available Bind Nickname. Bind Nicknames can be applied from `!bind`. If no bind nicknames apply to the user, then the **Global Nickname** is used instead.

**Global Nickname** → the default nickname used if someone has **NO** available Bind Nicknames. This can be applied from this command and `!settings change` \(look for "Nickname Template"\).
{% endhint %}
