## How do I switch my primary account?

Firstly you’ll have to add your new Roblox account to Bloxlink, the account you want to use as your new primary account. Use the `!verify add` command for that or go to [blox.link/verify](https://blox.link/verify). Do you need a hand? Watch this part of our verification tutorial:

When you are about to link your new account, make sure to tick the “Primary Account” box when you are typing in the Roblox name. _-This is an important step._ This will then set the new account you are about to link, as your primary account.
{% endhint %}

Great! You have linked your new account, and it is set as your primary now. Let's unlink your old account!  
Head to [blox.link/account](https://blox.link/account) and go to the `Roblox Accounts` section.
