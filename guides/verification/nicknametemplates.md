# Nicknames Templates üî¨

## Changing your nickname template

_**Option one:**_ To setup a nickname for **all users** that verify/join the server, you can run `/setup`. This will then create a prompt that will allow you to setup the nickname template, from the dropdown menu select which nickname template you would like to use. A common one to use is `{smart-name}`, this will name people their Roblox name (and their Display name, if they have any).  After selecting you may click the `skip, leave unchanged button` to skip through the rest of the prompts. Once completed select done, and then your settings will be saved for your nickname template.

_**Option Two:**_ The second way to setup the nickname template for _**all users**_ that verify/join the server. Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://blox.link/dashboard) and ensure you are signed into the correct account, once you ensure you are signed into the correct account click `manage servers` on the left side of your screen from the selection menu. You will then be taken to a list of your servers that you own or can manage, click on your server then select the `verification` tab, you will then be greeted with many options, choose the nickname template that you would like to apply to your server, then select save. Now your template has been saved!

{% hint style="warning" %}
[üß†](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) **Note:** Templates must be spelled like Bloxlink shows you! You must include the curly brackets and dash. For example: `{smart-name}`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
[üßô](https://emojipedia.org/mage/) **Tips:** **Bind Nickname** ‚Üí when you link groups, you're given the option to change nicknames of group members. Bloxlink will choose the person's **highest role** which has an available Bind Nickname. Bind Nicknames can be applied from /`bind`. If no bind nicknames apply to the user, then the **Global Nickname** is used instead.

**Global Nickname** ‚Üí the default nickname used if someone has **NO** available Bind Nicknames. This can be applied from this command and `/settings` (look for "NicknameTemplate").
{% endhint %}

That's all! You have changed/edited your nickname template.

Thanks for using Bloxlink. [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/red-heart/)
