# How to setup Bloxlink üî®

Firstly, say `/setup` in your server! Make sure Bloxlink is able to view and talk in the channel.

This will start the setup process inside of the channel you ran the /setup command in.

Bloxlink will send you a `pre-configuration`! Make sure it has all permissions needed that it asks for.

Once you did, click the `Next` button, or say `next`.

Let's setup a nickname-template! Look trough the list and pick the one you like! If you do not want people to get nicknamed say `disable`. If you can't pick one, say `skip` and Bloxlink will use the default template (`{smart-name}`).

[üß†](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) **Note:** Templates must be spelled like Bloxlink shows you! You must include the curly brackets and dash. For example: `{smart-name}`
{% endhint %}

Now, provide your Roblox group ID or link! Both are OK. If you don't want a group linked or you already linked one, say `skip`.

Bloxlink will give a role to linked users with Bloxlink! If you wish to change this role name, provide the new name. If you want the default name (`Verified`) say `skip`. If you don't want Bloxlink give the verified role to users, say `disable`.

Upon joining Bloxlink creates two roles; the verified and unverified role. You **cannot** set the unverfied role with the /setup command. To edit your unverfied role please head to our [dashboard](https://blox.link/dashboard).

If you provided a Roblox group ID/link, Bloxlink will ask you if you want to **merge** or **replace** your Discord roles. Pick the one you want.

{% hint style="warning" %}
[üß†](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) **Note:**\
**Merge** will make Bloxlink create any missing roles from your group.

**Replace** will delete **all** your Discord roles and will create your group ranks. **Be careful**, this **can not be undone**.
{% endhint %}

That's all! You have set up Bloxlink in less than 5 minutes, click the done button and all your configuration will take effect!
