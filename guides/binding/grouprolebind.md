# Group Role Bind üß±

## What's a Group Role Bind?

Different than the Group Bind, a Group Rank Bind is when you bind, or link, one or multiple Discord role\(s\) to everyone in the Roblox group. This means, if you bind the Discord role "Group Member" to your group, everyone, no matter their group rank, will receive the role.

## Normal Usage

Firstly, let's start the bind process! Say `!bind` in your server. Make sure Bloxlink has permissions to view and talk in the channel.

Bloxlink has different binds types, but we will go with the `group` bind type!

Now, let's set a nickname-template for the users who meet this requirement. If you do not want one, say `skip` or say the template you want! Bloxlink provides you all available templates.

{% endhint %}

The next prompt is an **advanced option**! If you want Bloxlink to remove any additional role\(s\) the user has, if they meet the bind requirements, name those roles! If they are multiple roles, separate them with a comma.

{% hint style="warning" %}
[üß†](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) **Note:** 95% of the time, you should `skip` this option.  
Roles that are bound **can not** be removed, they **must** be not bound roles!
{% endhint %}

Now, let's provide the Roblox group ID of your group!

Bloxlink has two `group` bind types. In this case, we will say `select ranks`.

Now, let's provide the name\(s\) of the role\(s\) users should get if they meet the bind requirements! If there are multiple roles, separate them with a comma.

To make your all your group members get this role, say `everyone`!

That's all! You have successfully bound a role to all your group members!

## Advanced Usage

You are actually able to make an entire group-role-bind just in 1 command. The `<>` and keywords are just to demonstrate, so **remove** them and replace with what you'd like.

You shall **not** remove the `""`.

`!bind group "<nicknameTemplate>" "<removeRoles>" <groupID> "select ranks" "<addRoles>" everyone`

That's all! You have bound a role to all your group members in one command!

Thanks for using Bloxlink. [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/red-heart/)
