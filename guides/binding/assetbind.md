# Asset Bind üß∞

## What's an Asset Bind?

An Asset Bind is used to give a Discord role based off a Roblox asset. For example, catalog items or a paid game.

## Normal Usage

Make sure Bloxlink is able to view and type in the channel. Now say `!bind` and let's follow the prompts together.

Bloxlink offers different bind types, but we will use the `Asset` bind type. Use the dropdown or simply type it.

Now you can provide an optional nickname template to name users who own this asset a special nickname, for example.

This prompt is an **advanced option**. If you wish Bloxlink to remove any other Discord role, name it. This option is commonly used to remove roles given by another bot. These roles can't be a bind!

Now you can provide the respective asset ID of the item you want to bind. You can find the ID between `/catalog/` and `/YourItemName/` or between `/games/` and `/YourGameName/`, if it is a paid game. \(See second image\)

Provide the Discord role name\(s\) users should get if they meet the bind requirement.

That's it! You're going to see the asset ID and the bound Discord role on the success message.

## Advanced Usage

You are actually able to make an entire asset bind just in 1 command. The `<>` and keywords are just to demonstrate, so **remove** them and replace with what you'd like.

You shall **not** remove the `""`.

`!bind asset "<nicknameTemplate>" "<removeRoles>" <assetID> "<addRoles>"`

That's all! You have bound a role with an asset in one command!

Thanks for using Bloxlink. [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/red-heart/)
