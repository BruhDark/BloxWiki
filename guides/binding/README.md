# Binding ðŸ“¦

## Rank Bind

Rank Binds are useful to give Discord roles based off your Roblox group ranks. This bind type is commonly used to give out "secondary" Discord roles, like "Medium Rank", for example. Or, also when you want to have different Discord role names than your Roblox group ranks.

## Group Bind

Group Binds are useful to link your Roblox group and give your group ranks as Discord roles! A Group Bind adds and removes Discord roles, you don't need any extra bind.

## Group Role Bind

Group Role Binds are useful to give a role to every group member, no matter their rank! This bind type is commonly used to give roles like "Group Member" to know who is a member of your group!
