# Group Bind ‚öñÔ∏è

## What's a Group Bind?

A Group Bind is when you link a Roblox group to your Discord server. Different than the Group **Rank** Bind, the Group Bind makes Bloxlink add your Roblox group ranks to your users on Discord! This means, if a user has a group rank called "Customer", they will receive a role called "Customer" on Discord.

## Normal Usage

If you haven't ran the `/bind` command yet, you should configure your server first. You will be able to link a group trough the setup command.\
If you're looking to add a new group, keep reading!

{% content-ref url="../others/setup.md" %}
[setup.md](../others/setup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Firstly, let's start the bind process! Say `/bind` in your server. Make sure Bloxlink has permissions to view and talk in the channel.

Bloxlink has different bind types, but we will go with the `group` bind type!

Now, let's set a nickname-template for the users who meet this requirement. If you do not want one, say `skip` or say the template you want! Bloxlink provides you all available templates.

{% endhint %}

The next prompt is an **advanced option**! If you want Bloxlink to remove any additional role(s) the user has, if they meet the bind requirements, name those roles! If they are multiple roles, separate them with a comma.

{% hint style="warning" %}
[üß†](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) **Note:** 95% of the time, you should `skip` this option.\
Roles that are bound **can not** be removed, they **must** be not bound roles!
{% endhint %}

Now provide your Roblox group ID!

Bloxlink has two `group` bind types! In this case, we will say `entire group`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your Discord roles **must always match** with your group ranks names. Otherwise, Bloxlink will create the missing roles.
{% endhint %}

That's all! You have successfully bound a group to your Discord server! Users will now get their group ranks in your server.

Thanks for using Bloxlink. [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/red-heart/)
